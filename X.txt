Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Verbal Harassment and Misconduct by Senior Manager

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Siddharth Srivastava, and I am currently employed as a DTP Operator at BIG Language Solutions. I am writing this mail to formally bring to your attention a very serious matter of verbal harassment, intimidation, and misconduct that I faced on 10th September 2025 at the hands of Mr. Shashi Krit Singh (Senior Manager).

This incident, along with several past experiences, has left me deeply disturbed, humiliated, and unsafe in the workplace. I strongly believe that this matter requires urgent intervention from the Human Resource Department and higher management.

Details of the Incident on 10th September 2025

After I submitted my resignation (due to personal and medical reasons already conveyed to the management), I was unexpectedly called into Mr. Shashi Krit Singh‚Äôs cabin. Instead of a professional discussion, he began verbally abusing and insulting me in a highly derogatory and demeaning manner.

Some of his exact words included:

‚ÄúHow much money can you even make if you leave the organisation?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople like you should have been fired in the first place and should not even be hired.‚Äù

When I objected to his disrespectful tone, he said: ‚ÄúI can talk in whatever way I want and nobody can do anything about it.‚Äù

He further went on to threaten me by stating that he would not accept my resignation but instead terminate me so that I would not receive my relieving letter or experience certificate. He added that this was because I had supported Mr. Yin (Director of Solution Architecture) in his project work.

This was extremely shocking and demoralizing for me, especially since I had resigned in good faith for medical reasons.

Background of Previous Conflict with Mr. Shashi Krit Singh

A few weeks prior, Mr. Yin had visited India for the AEP Braille Project. As part of his mentoring, he asked me to support him with some automation work. I agreed willingly and respectfully, considering him a senior leader.

During one of my meetings with Mr. Yin, I was abruptly called by Mr. Vikarat, who questioned my presence in the meeting. I explained that it was requested directly by Mr. Yin. Later, when I informed Mr. Shashi Krit Singh about my involvement, his reaction was disturbing. He said:

‚ÄúI should have been informed first, because now if you do anything good for Mr. Yin, he (Shashi) won‚Äôt get the credit for it, instead someone from abroad will.‚Äù

This statement made me feel disgusted because it clearly showed his personal insecurity and willingness to compromise organizational interests for his own recognition. Following that, he rudely instructed me to stop working on any task related to Mr. Yin.

When I raised this issue with him, he trash-talked about Mr. Yin in my presence. When I said I might escalate it to HR, his response was chilling:

‚ÄúEven HR can‚Äôt do anything. They will reach out to me first.‚Äù

This clearly shows that he believes himself to be above accountability.

Pattern of Misconduct by Mr. Shashi Krit Singh

The incident on 10th September is not isolated. His behavior reflects a consistent pattern of harassment, intimidation, and unprofessionalism:

Verbal Harassment & Body Shaming ‚Äì He frequently demeans employees by making insulting comments about their appearance.

Misuse of Authority ‚Äì He often instructs employees to run his personal errands, such as fetching food from outside stalls, which is completely unacceptable in a professional workplace.

Hostile Work Environment ‚Äì His derogatory language, rude behavior, and repeated threats have created an unsafe and toxic atmosphere for me and many others in the DTP team.

Disrespect Towards Seniors ‚Äì His derogatory remarks about Mr. Yin, who is a senior leader and mentor, were extremely unprofessional and insulting not only to me but also to the organization‚Äôs hierarchy.

Impact on Me

I felt unsafe, humiliated, and emotionally distressed throughout the interaction in his cabin.

His threats about blocking my resignation papers and denying my experience/relieving letters have left me in constant fear about my career and future opportunities.

What should have been a professional transition due to health reasons has instead been turned into an atmosphere of intimidation and harassment.

My Request to HR and Management

I firmly believe that Human Resource is an independent body meant to protect employees and uphold fairness. Therefore, I request:

A formal inquiry into the behavior and misconduct of Mr. Shashi Krit Singh.

Immediate steps to ensure my resignation is processed smoothly and I am provided with my relieving and experience letters without further harassment.

Protection against further retaliation or intimidation.

Strict action against any senior staff who create a toxic workplace environment and misuse their authority.

Closing Statement

I have always respected my role at BIG Language Solutions and looked up to leaders like Mr. Yin, who have guided and mentored me professionally. However, my recent experience with Mr. Shashi Krit Singh has been deeply disheartening.

No employee should be made to feel insulted, unsafe, or powerless in the workplace. I sincerely request HR and senior management to take this complaint with the seriousness it deserves and take decisive action to prevent such behavior from continuing unchecked.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that the organisation will stand by its values and ensure a respectful workplace for all.

Sincerely,
Siddharth Srivastava

Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Verbal Harassment and Misconduct by Senior Manager

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Siddharth Srivastava, currently working as a DTP Operator at BIG Language Solutions. I am writing to formally raise a serious complaint regarding verbal harassment, intimidation, and misconduct by Mr. Shashi Krit Singh (Senior Manager) on 10th September 2025, which has left me deeply disturbed and unsafe in the workplace.

Incident on 10th September 2025

After I submitted my resignation (due to personal and medical reasons already communicated to management), I was called into Mr. Shashi Krit Singh‚Äôs cabin. Instead of a professional discussion, he insulted me in an extremely derogatory and threatening manner, using statements such as:

‚ÄúHow much money can you even make if you leave the organisation?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople like you should have been fired in the first place and should not even be hired.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can talk in whatever way I want and nobody can do anything about it.‚Äù

He further threatened to terminate me instead of accepting my resignation and said that I would not receive my relieving or experience letters. He stated this was because I supported Mr. Yin (Director of Solution Architecture) in the AEP Braille project.

Background of Previous Conflict

A few weeks earlier, while assisting Mr. Yin on the AEP Braille Project, Mr. Shashi Krit Singh expressed that if I did any meaningful work for Mr. Yin, ‚Äúhe (Shashi) would not get any credit, and someone from abroad would.‚Äù He then ordered me to stop helping Mr. Yin.

When I mentioned that I might escalate his behavior to HR, his response was:

‚ÄúEven HR can‚Äôt do anything; they will reach out to me first.‚Äù

This shows he believes himself to be above accountability, which is extremely alarming.

Pattern of Misconduct

This is not an isolated event. His behavior shows a pattern of:

Verbal Harassment & Body Shaming of employees.

Misuse of Authority by asking staff to run personal errands (e.g., bringing food).

Disrespect Towards Seniors, including derogatory remarks about Mr. Yin.

Creating a hostile and unsafe work environment for juniors.

Impact on Me

I felt humiliated, unsafe, and emotionally distressed during the incident.

His threats about blocking my resignation and papers have caused fear about my future career opportunities.

What should have been a professional exit due to health reasons has turned into harassment and intimidation.

My Request to HR and Management

I respectfully request the following:

A formal inquiry into the misconduct of Mr. Shashi Krit Singh.

Assurance that my resignation will be processed smoothly and my relieving/experience letters will be provided.

Protection from any further retaliation.

Strict action against unprofessional behavior by senior staff to prevent such issues in the future.

Closing

I have always respected my role and appreciated the mentorship of leaders like Mr. Yin. However, this experience has been deeply disheartening. No employee should feel insulted, unsafe, or powerless in the workplace.

I sincerely request HR and management to look into this matter urgently and take decisive action to uphold the dignity of employees and the values of BIG Language Solutions.

Thank you for your attention.

‚úÖ This version is email-ready, structured, and professional but still conveys the severity of the issue.

Do you also want me to add legal language (like mentioning workplace harassment policy, POSH Act, or escalation to labor authorities) to make it even stronger?
